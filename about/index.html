            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>My name is Robert Bennett Keefe. I go by Ben.</p>
            <p>My sensibilities are trusting and honest, something simple-minded and Midwestern. At first glance I'm a bit of a puzzle-box, a triply-locked safe, but as it turns out, the locks are already open, or maybe the keys already dangling from their cylinders. I'm an open book, if you couldn't tell by the paragraphs of semi-personal text written on a public website.</p>
            <p>This is all thanks to a rather quiet upbringing in Kansas City, surrounded by a combination of busy middle-class love and a splash of mostly-normal Roman Catholic pedagogy. At Rockhurst High School, my tendencies for stay-in weekends and hibernating in the winter developed into a firm obsession with video games, computers, and the internet. Enough hours behind a screen can turn any academic-minded teenager into a committed computer science student, and so after an offbeat gap year in lockdown, I tried to mix up my life without shifting its trajectory too far from predictability. I did CS at the Colorado School of Mines, and after three years spent somewhere between total academic hermitage and spiritual adventurism in the American West, I graduated with a BS in CS. Some sort of strong headwind tells me Kansas City needs me back, and that I need a regrounding of the sensibilities that got me started in all this. And so I'm coming home for round 2, suddenly grown up and confidently unprepared for whatever may happen next.</p>
            <!-- <h2 name="long-bio">A Far More Long-Winded Bio</h2>
            <p>My name is Ben. Legally, it's Robert <b>Ben</b>nett Keefe, but I've always gone by Ben. It's one of those little things that I'm always covering for. Takeout order? It's Ben. Plane ticket? Robert. New friends? My name's Ben. Job application? Hmmm... probably safest to put my legal name. But when I shake the interviewer's hand, "Hi, my name's Ben." </p>
            <p>"Hi Robert," they'll say. I usually don't bother correcting them there.</p>
            <p>My name, whose origin I can never pinpoint without clumsily explaining that my dad has the same problem, that my grandpa actually <it>does</it> go by his first name, Robert, and that really, it doesn't matter once you get to know me. Because when you do get to know me, what's my legal name matter to you anymore? That story dissolves into the background of my character, it's something to talk about at parties, an indication of the sphere of my life someone is from. If someone's calling me Robert, it must be professional, legal, or an unoriginal joke.</p>
            <p>I'm from Kansas City, born and raised without ever leaving that little house I grew up in. Somehow I landed in two Catholic schools in that time, and if grade school at Visitation taught me anything, it's that I was always preparing for more. Rockhurst was the logical next step for a teenage boy leaving Vis, and who was I to violate that order? It was there I went from a child enamored with video games to a teenager obsessed with them. I started taking computer science classes because I thought it might propel me to some game-making ends, and because time spent around video games is time spent on computers, and time spent on computers translates into marketable skills when you do well enough in school.</p>
            <p>So I did the CS thing, and spent every moment I had outside of school either playing video games or writing Java code for our robotics team. We had a competition, our first of that season, in St. Louis. I would be there during my 18th birthday, and we'd gone through the tedious process of preparing the pit and gaming out the competition. This being my birthday, March 13th, 2020, the world decided to shut down and we got sent home right as we were settling in. I finished the year quietly, from home, and had enrolled at CU Boulder with some vague desire to shift my life dramatically.</p>
            <p>But it wasn't the time. I unenrolled. I took a gap year. I went on a big roadtrip round the great expansive powerful country we so often take for granted. I worked, quietly still, locked down like huddled masses in a bunker braving the storm, and I loved those people I worked with in that bakery in Kansas City.</p>
            <p>But time passed, and by summer I was off on a (rescheduled from 2020) trip to the other side of the world, where I found myself staring out at the white-gold expanse at 19,000 feet, <a href="../projects/photography/index.html#africa">Mount Kilimanjaro,</a> some godly place it was. I descended and my time back home was short-lived. I moved to Colorado, but not for CU Boulder. Instead, I had landed in this strange academy of madly academic, terribly awkward, and yet uncompromisingly fortuitious nature. Every student at the Colorado School of Mines seems driven by some spite at their own decision to pursue the rigor of this place, to stare at the blazing sun of project after project, exam after exam, until they understood the fusion reactions going on up there, 94 million miles away.</p>
            <p>It's in this place I spent three formative years. I lived an entirely different life here, one that has undoubtedly shaped the way I am to approach the world ahead of me. It is with this confidence in the thickness of my own skin, this indignance to the harshness of the world, that I go about trying to help its problems and to take on its challenges.</p>
            <p>For one reason or another, I'm moving back to Kansas City. It's where I belong. Or at least, it's where I feel drawn to in this moment, and really that's all it takes. My story has taken me many places and, like clouds parting to the sunshine cast down upon my face, I feel it good and natural that I should return home now. I was stuck there, I felt trapped there, either by COVID or by my own habits, and now I'm ready to go back with a newfound creative and adventurous energy, one that I hope can not just transform my experience of the place, but transform the place around me as well.</p> -->
