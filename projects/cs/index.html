            <h2>Computer Science Projects</h2>
            <p>This page is dedicated to my computer science projects. I graduated from the Colorado School of Mines with a bachelor's of science in Computer Science in 2024, but I have pursued computer science since before high school. Having come from a background of a lot of video games, and a lot of science and mathematics, it was always a natural thing for me to practice computers science.</p>
            <p>Most of my personal CS projects are for fun -- they relate to or involve subjects I enjoy and are not intended to be products or 'marketable' tools or software. That doesn't mean they're <i>not</i> marketable or useful as products, just that the focus is on what I find interesting, fun, novel, or insightful about a given project, rather than its applicability to a market.</p>
            <p>With that said, here's a few of those projects!</p>
