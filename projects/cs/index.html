            <h2>Computer Science Projects</h2>
            <p>This page is dedicated to my computer science projects. I graduated from the Colorado School of Mines with a bachelor's of science in Computer Science in 2024, but I have pursued computer science since before high school. Having come from a background of a lot of video games, and a lot of science and mathematics, it was always a natural thing for me to practice computers science.</p>
            <p>Most of my personal CS projects are for fun! The focus is on what I find interesting, fun, novel, or insightful about a given subject, toolkit, or idea.</p>
            <p>With that said, here's a few of those projects!</p>
            <div id="cs-projects">
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h1><a href="https://github.com/bkeefe313/SpotifAI">SpotifAI</a></h1>
                        <p>This is an application that attempts to create a chatbot assistant with OpenAI's assistant framework that can interface with a user's Spotify application and library, as well as research tools (in the form of Wikipedia API calls) to inform the subject of conversation and recommendation.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h1><a href="https://github.com/bkeefe313/CSCI441_FP">Perlin Noise Terrain Generation, and a Horror Game</a></h1>
                        <p>This was a school project that I went all-in on -- it was a group project, but I put a lot of personal effort into it. It is an OpenGL application written in C++, mostly from the ground up, that generates navigable terrain for a horror game using a Perlin Noise generator to create a heightmap texture. It's the culmination of a whole lot of shader programming, OpenGL topics, and fun CS bits relating to noise generation and game-making.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h1><a href="https://github.com/bkeefe313/KISG">The Knight In Shining Garbage</a></h1>
                        <p>This is a project done in Unity for a game dev class. It's a rogue-like similar to <it>Risk of Rain 2</it>, where you play as a trash knight -- Instead of riding a horse, you're in a shopping cart.<br>My general experience with Unity is a complex practice of combining tools and processes -- this was no exception. A lot of moving parts have to go together to make a game work, but this was super fun to work on. This is really just a repo of the Unity project, so it's not directly playable except through Unity.</p>
