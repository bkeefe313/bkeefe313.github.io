            <h2>Photography</h2>
            <p>I have a fascination with the way the world may align itself in such a way that it can tell a story, describe itself in such succinct moments of absolute clarity, and all through this enormously complex and yet somehow simple process of light projecting itself onto our eyes. With a camera I hope to capture such an alignment, an image to keep safe what the world showed me, and the ability to share that beyond the place it happened.</p>

                    <p>In 2021, after a year's delay due to circumstances you could probably guess, I went with a group to Tanzania to summit Mount Kilimanjaro, the world's tallest free-standing mountain, and Africa's highest peak, at over 19,000 feet. While in that distant and beautiful place I saw things photos could never do justice, but I took many photos regardless, and these are the ones I think do the best job showing what I saw and felt.</p>

                    <p>In 2022, a year after Kilimanjaro, I went to Nepal with a similar group for what I assumed to be my last big trip for a while. We trekked to Everest base camp. The Himalayas are a magical place, there's really no way to describe quite how small those beastly mountains make a person feel. And the stray Sherpa dogs were better behaved than most people's pets.</p>

                    <p>I am new to film photography, and I am also new to developing my own B&W film -- but both are fun and challenging in their own ways that make the process that much more engaging and interesting. There's something that analog seems to capture, too, that digital has never been able to do for me.</p>

                    <h1>Road Trips</h1>
                    <p>Road trips are my new method of adventuring. We have a grand old country here to explore the corners of. These are from my trips I took during college in Colorado, so in that western Colorado/Utah/Wyoming/Idaho section of the continental US. It is a wonderful place packed so full of remarkable land formations that it's easy to forget how amazing it all is.</p>
