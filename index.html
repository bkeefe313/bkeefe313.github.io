            <h2>Hello!</h2>
            <p>This is a public-facing webpage that serves as a home for things I deem worthy of sharing with a public audience.</p>
            <p>I have just graduated with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, so this puts in me a position where I understand how to build a website to do this sort of thing.</p>
            <p>This does not mean, however, that this website is a place exclusively for my CS-related pursuits. Those are here (see my <a href="projects/cs/index.html"> CS projects</a> page), but I also figured I should include the other work I do that I feel is worth sharing. That includes <a href="projects/writing/index.html">writing</a>, <a href="projects/photography/">photograpy</a>, <a href="projects/music/index.html">music</a>, and whatever else I decide has a place on my personal website.</p>
            <h2>Looking for Something?</h2>
            <p>I include a link to this website on professional applications, since this is a pretty and centralized method of sharing my work, especially CS projects. If you are an employer, or are interested in my CS work for any reason, head on over to my <a href="projects/cs/index.html"> CS projects page</a>.</p>
            <p>If you are looking for my writing (for some reason) or my other personal artwork, like photographs, video games, or music, I encourage you to browse my various projects on your own. I appreciate your engagement with my work.</p>
            <h2>Questions?</h2>
            <p>Feel free to <a href="contact/index.html">contact</a> me via any methods listed on this site.</p>
