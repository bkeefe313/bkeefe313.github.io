            <h2>Hello!</h2>
            <p>This is a public-facing webpage that serves as a home for things I deem worthy of sharing with most everyone.</p>
            <p>I have just finished 3 years at the Colorado School of Mines and graduated with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. So a website makes sense, huh?</p>
            <p>This isn't necessarily just for CS projects. Those are <a href="projects/cs/index.html">here</a>, but I also include other work I do I find worth sharing. That includes <a href="projects/writing/index.html">writing</a>, <a href="projects/photography/">photograpy</a>, and anything else that seems fitting for this space.</p>
            <h2>Looking for Something?</h2>
            <p>I include a link to this website on professional applications, since this is a pretty and centralized method of sharing my work, especially CS projects. If you are an employer, or are interested in my CS work for any reason, head on over to my <a href="projects/cs/index.html"> CS projects page</a>.</p>
            <p>If you are looking for my writing (for some reason) or my other work, like photography, I encourage you to browse my various projects on your own. I appreciate your engagement with it all.</p>
            <h2>Questions?</h2>
            <p>Feel free to <a href="contact/index.html">contact</a> me via any methods listed on this site.</p>
